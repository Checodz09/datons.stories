    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Spain's current energy landscape reveals a notable mix of renewable and non-renewable energy sources, each contributing distinct advantages and challenges to the power grid. While renewable sources such as Eolic energy have substantial installed capacities, their variability based on climatic conditions necessitates a complementary role from non-renewable sources like Combined Cycle to ensure consistent energy availability. The data also underscores the importance of Nuclear energy in terms of utilization efficiency, given its high ratio of actual to potential energy generation. Such insights highlight the complexity and intricacy of managing a national power grid with diverse energy sources."
