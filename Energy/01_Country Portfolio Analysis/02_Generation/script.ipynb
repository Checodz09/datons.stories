    "Summer favors Solar generation, while winter favors Eolic.\n",

    "However, it is not enough to rely upon renewable energy sources because they don't have a tap to generate energy when demands growth and there are no more hours of sun.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is room for renewable energy growth because more Solar Thermal energy could be supplied in months like September as the Sun hits harder due to climate change; replacing some of the energy that Combined Cycle produces."
